## bdd\_data\_extractor

`bdd_data_extractor` is a Python script to extract data from the [Base dos Dados](https://basedosdados.org/) platform using SQL queries. The script reads an SQL file, executes the query using the Base dos Dados library, and saves the resulting dataset to a CSV file.

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Install Required Python Libraries

Ensure you have Python installed and install the `basedosdados` library:

```bash
pip install basedosdados
```

#### 2. Set Up Google Cloud Billing Project

To query the Base dos Dados platform, you need a Google Cloud Billing Project ID. Visit the [Base dos Dados documentation](https://basedosdados.github.io/mais/) to configure your Google Cloud credentials and enable billing.

#### 3. Prepare Your Query

Write your SQL query in a `.sql` file and ensure it aligns with the structure of the datasets available on Base dos Dados.

### Usage

#### Command-Line Arguments

The script expects the following arguments:

1. **Query File**: Path to the `.sql` file containing the query.
2. **Billing Project ID**: Your Google Cloud Billing Project ID.
3. **Output File**: Path where the resulting CSV file will be saved.

#### Running the Script

Run the script as follows:

```bash
python bdd_data_extractor.py <query_file> <billing_project_id> <output_file>
```

##### Example

```bash
python bdd_data_extractor.py resource/sql/br_ibge_pam.lavoura_permanente.sql my-billing-project-id output.csv
```

#### Script Description

1. **Validation**: The script checks that exactly three arguments (besides the script name) are provided. If the count is invalid, it raises an error:

   ```
   ValueError: Invalid number of arguments. Expected 3, but got X.
   ```

2. **SQL Query Execution**: Reads the SQL file and executes it against the Base dos Dados platform using the provided Billing Project ID.

3. **Output**: Saves the resulting data into a CSV file at the specified path.

### Notes

- Ensure your Google Cloud credentials are configured correctly and have permission to query Base dos Dados datasets.
- Review the documentation for the `basedosdados` library for advanced usage and query customization: [BasedosDados Documentation](https://basedosdados.github.io/mais/).
